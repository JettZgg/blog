# 7-Day LeetCode Intensive Plan (~100 Hours)

## Day 1: Foundations (Arrays, Strings, HashMaps)
* **Focus:** Core data structure manipulations, lookups, frequency counts, edge cases.
* **Topics:** Arrays, Strings, HashMaps (Dictionaries), Sets, `collections.Counter`, `collections.defaultdict`.

## Day 2: Sorting & Searching
* **Focus:** Leveraging sorting, implementing Binary Search correctly on arrays and concept ranges.
* **Topics:** Built-in Sorting (`key` argument), Binary Search variations.

## Day 3: Two Pointers & Sliding Window
* **Focus:** Efficient iteration patterns (opposite ends, fast/slow, fixed/variable window), managing window state.
* **Topics:** Two Pointer Techniques, Sliding Window Techniques.

## Day 4: Linked Lists
* **Focus:** Pointer manipulation, traversal, common patterns (reversal, cycle detection, merge, fast/slow).
* **Topics:** Singly Linked List implementation, Traversal, Reversal, Merging, Cycle Detection, Dummy Nodes.

## Day 5: Trees (BFS & DFS)
* **Focus:** Implementing standard traversals, understanding BFS vs DFS use cases, tree properties.
* **Topics:** Tree Node structure, DFS (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder - Recursive & Iterative), BFS (Level Order), BST properties.

## Day 6: Heaps (Priority Queues) & Intro to Graphs
* **Focus:** Using `heapq` for Top K / Median problems, basic graph representation and traversal (BFS/DFS).
* **Topics:** `heapq` module (min-heaps, simulating max-heaps), Graph Representation (Adjacency List), Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS).

## Day 7: Intro to Dynamic Programming (DP) & Review
* **Focus:** Recognizing basic DP patterns (memoization/recursion), comprehensive review, pattern identification practice.
* **Topics:** Basic DP concepts (Overlapping Subproblems, Optimal Substructure), Memoization. Mixed review of all previous topics.
