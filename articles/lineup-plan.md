# LineUp Plan
## What is LineUp
We got online Chess, Go, but we never got online Gomoku grinding platform, I want to build one, and make the easiest grinding game in the world.

## How to play
- **Winning Condition**: Align a specified number of pieces in a row (3-9).
- **Board Size**: Width and height range from 3 to 19.
- **Minimum Board Size**: At least as large as the number of pieces needed to win.
- **First to Win**: The first player to align the required number of pieces wins.
- **Tie Condition**: Board is filled and no player has won.
